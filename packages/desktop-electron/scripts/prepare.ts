// Actions artifact. Run outside CI — which is how the local Windows packages
// are produced — the download failed, nothing landed in `resources/`, and
// electron-builder's `opencode-cli*` filter matched zero files. The app
// packaged and installed fine and then had no backend to spawn at all, which
// the UI reports as "cannot reach the local server".
