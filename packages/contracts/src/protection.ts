/**
 * At-rest protection envelope — Plan V2.3.1 §74, ADR-005 + ADR-010.
 *
 * The AtRestProtectionEnvelope is the durable record that an
 * artifact (or other secret-bearing object) was encrypted at rest,
 * and the metadata a key-resolver needs to decrypt it. The envelope
 * travels with the ciphertext; without it, the bytes are opaque.
 *
 * Three protection schemes are supported:
 *   - `envelope`    : the artifact is encrypted with a fresh DEK,
 *                     which is itself wrapped by a KEK identified
 *                     by `keyRef`. The wrapped DEK is in
 *                     `wrappedDataKey`.
 *   - `DEK-wrapped` : same as envelope, but the DEK is named
 *                     directly in `keyRef` (no KEK indirection).
 *   - `OS-keyring`  : the encryption key is held in the OS
 *                     keyring (DPAPI / Keychain / libsecret). The
 *                     `keyRef` is a stable string the keyring
 *                     understands. `wrappedDataKey` is absent.
 *
 * The `aadDomain` field binds the ciphertext to a logical
 * application (e.g. "artifact-content", "credential-material",
 * "audit-row") so a ciphertext for one use cannot be replayed as
 * a ciphertext for another. The AAD is part of the GCM tag, so
 * the platform's primitive (AES-256-GCM, ADR-010) refuses the
 * swap automatically.
 *
 * `version: 1` is the schema version of the envelope shape. A new
 * field is added by bumping the version, not by overloading an
 * existing one.
