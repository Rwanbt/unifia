/**
 * Session event hub: assigns replay sequences and serves reconnecting readers.
 *
 * WHY this exists: `RuntimeEvent.sequence` and `subscribeEvents(afterSequence)`
 * were added so an interrupted stream can resume where it stopped — a Phase 2
 * exit criterion ("les événements sont rejouables"). A backend that emits no
 * sequence makes the server omit the SSE `id:` line, which leaves the client
 * with nothing to resume from; a backend that ignores `afterSequence` hands a
 * reconnecting client only what happens next, silently losing whatever arrived
 * while it was away. Both failures are invisible until someone reconnects.
 *
 * The hub is deliberately transport-agnostic and free of any runtime
 * dependency, so the sequencing contract can be proven without booting a
 * runtime.
