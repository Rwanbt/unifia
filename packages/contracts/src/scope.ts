 * Ownership + Deployment scopes — Plan V2.3.1 §44-§45, ADR-020.

 * OwnershipScope is the durable ownership of a logical entity
 * (workflow, artifact, credential, …) by an org / project / workspace
 * triple. DeploymentScope extends it with the environment in which a
 * concrete deployment lives. The two are the canonical address forms
 * used by every other contract in this package: a digest is bound to
 * a deployment, an artifact is owned by an org/project/workspace, a
 * credential is scoped to an ownership triple.
 *
 * The fields are intentionally narrow — the rules around who can mint,
 * move, or delete a scope are owned by ADR-020 and not duplicated
 * here. This module is a *contract*, not a policy.
