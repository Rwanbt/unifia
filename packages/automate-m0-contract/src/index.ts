 * Qualification-only. This package exists to let two candidate durable
 * authorities be measured against the *same* semantics; it is not a
 * production package and nothing outside the M0 harness should depend on
 * it. ADR-000 §17 is explicit that "le contrat M0 n'est pas encore le

 * deliberately kept apart so the harness cannot inherit an M1 decision.
