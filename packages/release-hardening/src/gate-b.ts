/**
 * Gate B — Plan V3 §24, "Cowork local-first sécurisé".
 *
 * §24 has two lists: twelve GO conditions and seven NO-GO conditions. They are
 * not symmetric, and treating them as one checklist is how a gate gets waved
 * through.
 *
 * A GO condition is a capability: it can be demonstrated. A NO-GO condition is a
 * **prohibition** — it is not satisfied by building something, it is satisfied
 * by proving the system *refuses*. "Computer use global" is not a feature
 * someone forgot to finish; it is a state the product must never be able to
 * reach. So each NO-GO entry drives the code and asserts a refusal, and an entry
 * that merely claims the danger is absent fails the matrix.
 *
 * This is why the two are kept apart here rather than merged: a GO condition
 * with no evidence is unfinished work, while a NO-GO condition with no evidence
 * is an open hole, and reporting them with the same word hides that difference.
