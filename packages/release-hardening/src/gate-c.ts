/**
 * Gate C — Plan V3 §31, "Plateforme extensible stabilisée".
 *
 * Ten GO conditions and no NO-GO list, so it reuses the Gate B runner.
 *
 * The reason this exists is that Gate C's recorded verdict had gone stale. It
 * read `NO-GO` with five blockers — "Phase 11 absente, cœur Phase 12 absent,
 * pas de consommateur DOM, pas de bootstrap serveur, audit externe absent" —
 * and four of those five had since been delivered. A gate whose verdict is a
 * remembered opinion drifts in both directions: it blocks on work already done,
 * and it stops naming the thing that actually blocks.
 *
 * Running it produces a verdict with the *current* blockers named. It is still
 * NO-GO, and now for two reasons instead of five stale ones.
