// =============================================================================
// repair-coordinator.ts — TEAM-I02
//
// Turns a CHANGES_REQUESTED review verdict into a new, bounded repair
// attempt. It never edits the attempt that was reviewed: a reviewed commit is
// evidence, and rewriting it would invalidate the verdict that refers to it.
// Each repair is a fresh attempt with its own fencing token, carrying forward
// the parts the reviewer already approved as frozen.
//
// Three properties the card requires, and where they live here:
//
//   No mutation of a reviewed attempt   `planRepair` only ever produces a new
//                                       attempt descriptor. The reviewed
//                                       commit is copied into it as an
//                                       immutable parent reference, and the
//                                       frozen paths are refused to writers.
//
//   Cost tracked                        Every attempt carries its own usage,
//                                       and the coordinator accumulates the
//                                       total across the repair chain, so the
//                                       cost of repairing is visible next to
//                                       the cost of the original attempt
//                                       rather than disappearing into it.
//
//   Stop on architecture conflict       A finding that reports an
//                                       architectural conflict is not
//                                       repairable by another local attempt.
//                                       Retrying it would burn attempts on a
//                                       decision only a human can make, so the
//                                       coordinator stops and says so.
//
// Bounded by construction: attempts are capped, and the cap is checked before
// any work is planned rather than after it has been spent.
//
// Pure: no LLM, network, git, clock or filesystem access. The caller supplies
// the review result and the attempt history; the coordinator decides.
