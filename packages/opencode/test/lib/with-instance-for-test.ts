/**
 * withInstanceForTest — Sprint 6 item 1 skeleton.
 *
 * Goal: give test authors a single entry point to run Effect-context aware
 * code (team tool, session runtime, permission checks) inside a minimal
 * InstanceContext wired to a tmpdir, without spawning a real Hono server.
 *
 * Status: SKELETON. Boots the ALS InstanceContext via `Instance.provide` on
 * a transient tmpdir project; the caller's `fn` runs with `Instance.directory`
 * et al. available. What is NOT yet wired (and prevents the `describe.skip`
 * in dag-team.test.ts from flipping):
 *
 *   [x] InstanceContext (directory, worktree, project) via Instance.provide.
 *   [ ] InstanceState backing via Layer.memoize — today each test falls back
 *       to the global default layer; for hermetic tests we want a fresh
 *       InstanceState per call (Layer.memoize on a per-test scope).
 *   [ ] Bus in-memory — the global bus is already process-scoped; tests can
 *       collect events via `Bus.subscribeAll` today, but a dedicated test
 *       bus would prevent cross-test leakage.
 *   [ ] SessionStatus / Session / Task in-memory — these services currently
 *       hit the real SQLite DB (in-memory via UNIFIA_DB=:memory: from
 *       preload.ts). That works, but a pure in-memory variant would avoid
 *       the SQL schema coupling and make call-site mocking easier.
 *   [ ] Permission in-memory — a test-time Permission.Service that auto-grants
 *       (or auto-denies) without prompting. Today the real permission service
 *       reads from config and can block on confirmations.
 *   [ ] Provider-mounted-on-mock — seed the provider registry with the
 *       `createMockProvider` harness so `session/llm.ts` resolves the mock
 *       model by default. Needs a test-only Provider.register() hook or a
 *       global override in Provider.list().
 *
 * Until those are wired, `test/e2e/dag-team.test.ts` full-e2e stays skipped.
 * The `dispatchDag` unit tests in the same file continue to guard the
 * ordering contract.
 *
 * Usage (once wired):
 *
 *   await withInstanceForTest(async () => {
 *     // team-tool dispatch goes here
 *   })
