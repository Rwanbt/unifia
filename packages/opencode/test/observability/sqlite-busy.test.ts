// Standalone proof that SQLite really throws SQLITE_BUSY under write
// contention with a low busy_timeout (PLAN-Native-Observability-V3, P0 test
// matrix). Deliberately decoupled from the app's shared process-wide
// `:memory:` Database singleton (storage/db.ts) — that singleton is booted
// once for the whole test binary (test/preload.ts) and every other test
// file writes through it; redirecting it to a real file mid-suite to force
// contention would risk destabilizing unrelated tests sharing the same
// connection. ObservabilityService.flush() (service.ts) already catches ANY
// writer exception uniformly regardless of SQLite error code — proven
// separately by service.test.ts's "opens circuit on database failure" test.
// Together, these two tests close the loop: SQLite really produces this
// failure mode under contention, and the service handles it (and any other
// writer failure) the same safe, non-blocking way.
