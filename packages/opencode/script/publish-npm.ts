/**
 * Publishes the Unifia CLI to npm: one package per platform, plus the
 * `unifia-ai` stub that resolves to whichever of them fits the host.
 *
 * Separate from `script/publish.ts` on purpose. That file is upstream's, still
 * reachable only from `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (gated on
 * `anomalyco/opencode`, so dead in this fork), and it also pushes a container
 * to upstream's registry and rewrites upstream's AUR and Homebrew packages.
 * Keeping it untouched keeps the monthly upstream sync conflict-free; this file
 * is the fork's own path and owns only npm.
 *
 *   UNIFIA_VERSION=1.3.16 UNIFIA_CHANNEL=latest UNIFIA_NPM_DRY_RUN=1 \
 *     bun packages/opencode/script/publish-npm.ts
 *
 * Expects `script/build.ts --all` to have populated dist/ first.
