/**
 * V1 → V2 IR mapping. Per ADR-017 §70-84 + plan V2.3.1 §182-185 +
 * §222-223.
 *
 * The mapping is **pure** and **deterministic** — given a V1 fixture,
 * the same V2 WorkflowDefinition comes out, every time. That property
 * is what makes the migration CI (plan §185) testable: a V1 fixture
 * is replayed, the migrator runs, the result is parsed by V2 spec, and
 * the parsed V2 WorkflowDefinition is compared to a known-good V2
 * expectation. No floats, no timestamps, no `Math.random`.
 *
 * The mapping is also **lossy on purpose** where V2 cannot express
 * V1 semantics faithfully. Those losses are returned in a
 * `MigrationWarning` so the operator can decide whether to:
 *   (a) accept the warning and proceed,
 *   (b) fix the V1 fixture by hand and re-migrate, or
 *   (c) fall back to the `finish legacy` / `cancel + restart V2`
 *       strategies listed in ADR-017 §60-66.
 *
 * The mapping is **not** the V2 runtime. The runtime (parses the
 * V2 IR, runs the durable execution, talks to substrate) is the
 * `WorkflowRuntime` (M1-09) and remains blocked by ADR-000. What
 * we produce here is a structurally valid V2 IR; the consumer is
 * expected to call `z.parse(WorkflowDefinitionSchema, result)` to
 * confirm.
