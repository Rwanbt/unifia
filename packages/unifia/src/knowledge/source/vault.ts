 * and `readFile` *on that path* leaves a window. Every one of those calls
 * resolves the name again, so an actor who replaces the directory entry
 * between them gets their content read out of a location that passed the
 * containment check. Re-running `realpath` before the read narrows the
 * window; it does not close it, because the read still goes by name.
 *
 * This closes it by changing what the read is addressed to:
 *
 *   1. capture the identity of the validated path with synchronous `lstat`;
 *   2. open it once, with `O_NOFOLLOW` where the platform has it;
 *   3. `fstat` the descriptor and require the same identity. A swap that
 *      raced step 2 shows up as a mismatch;
 *   4. re-check the directory entry after opening, then read bytes from the
 *      descriptor.
 *
 * After step 2 the descriptor names an inode, not a path, so no later
 * substitution can redirect the read at all. `null` means absent — a
 * containment or identity failure throws, because "not found" and "someone
 * swapped this file" must not reach the caller as the same answer.
