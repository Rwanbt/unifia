 * `mcp-token` subcommands (cards C22 and C16).
 *
 * Every invocation used to build its own `McpTokenRegistry`, so `issue`
 * printed a token that no later command could see, `check` always answered
 * "invalid" and exited 1, and `revoke` always threw "unknown token". The
 * three commands could not work as written: a token lives in the memory of
 * the server that will honour it, and V1 has no daemon to hold one.
 *
 * `session` is the honest replacement — it composes a real server, issues a
 * token against it, exercises a call, revokes, and shows the refusal, all in
 * the one process where those steps mean something. `issue`, `check` and
 * `revoke` now say why they cannot work across invocations instead of
 * printing a misleading answer.
