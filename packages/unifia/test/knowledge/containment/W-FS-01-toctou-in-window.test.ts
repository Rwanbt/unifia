/**
 * P1-C — the swap is injected *inside* one read, in the window that matters.
 *
 * `W-FS-01-toctou.test.ts` swaps the entry between two complete calls to
 * `read()`. That proves the second call re-validates; it says nothing about
 * the window the finding named, which is *within* a single invocation:
 * between the moment the path is validated and the moment its bytes are
 * pulled. A `realpath`-then-`stat`-then-`readFile` sequence resolves the
 * name three times, and an actor who replaces the directory entry between
 * any two of them has their file read out of a location that passed the
 * containment check.
 *
 * These tests open that window from inside the read path. The first
 * filesystem call the read makes is hooked, and the hook performs the swap
 * before returning — so by construction the substitution lands after
 * validation and before the bytes are fetched, every run, with no timing to
 * lose. Hooking `lstat` *and* `stat` keeps the injection honest against
 * either shape of implementation: the path-based one calls `stat`, the
 * descriptor-based one calls `lstat`.
 *
 * The contract under test is narrow and absolute: whatever else happens,
 * the call must never return the substituted content.
