/**
 * The knowledge core is reachable from the binary that ships (R-0019).
 *
 * Every other test in this suite proved the core *works*. None proved it was
 * *in the product*. It was not: `script/build.ts` compiles a single
 * entrypoint, `src/index.ts`, and the knowledge CLI lived in `bin/` with no
 * importer anywhere. The bundler dropped the module — a string search of the
 * built 185 MB sidecar returned zero hits for `control-log.jsonl`,
 * `unifia_restrictions` and `egress.decision`, against 607 for `unifia`.
 *
 * 883 green tests, four counter-reviews and six report reviews did not catch
 * it, because every one of them asked whether the code was correct and none
 * asked whether it was connected.
 *
 * So these tests assert reachability itself, from the entrypoint outward.
