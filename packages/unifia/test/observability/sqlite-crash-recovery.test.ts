// Standalone proof that a hard kill mid-write (SIGKILL, no chance to run any
// cleanup/rollback code) never leaves the observability DB with a partially
// committed row or a corrupted file (PLAN-Native-Observability-V3, P0 test
// matrix — "crash recovery", previously unverified). This is a real crash,
// not a simulated one: a genuine child process is spawned, starts a real
// uncommitted transaction against a real file-backed DB, and is killed by
// the OS from the outside while that transaction is still open.
//
// journal_mode=WAL (storage/db.ts) is exactly the mode that makes this
// safe: an uncommitted transaction's writes only ever land in the WAL file,
// which the next connection to open the DB discards on recovery. Decoupled
// from the shared process-wide `:memory:` Database singleton for the same
// reason as sqlite-busy.test.ts/sqlite-full.test.ts — this needs a real
// file-backed DB and a real second process, neither of which the shared
// in-memory test singleton can provide.
