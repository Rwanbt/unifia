// ui/components/team-graph.tsx — TEAM-M03
//
// The interactive task graph of a Team run, as a reusable component.
//
// Lives in packages/ui because the desktop app and mobile draw the same graph
// and must not each grow their own version of "which task is blocked by which"
// — that is one fact, and it gets one owner.
//
// The layout arrives already computed. Deciding a graph's shape and drawing it
// are separate jobs, and only the first one has a right answer that can be
// tested; the pure part of that decision lives below the component and is
// exercised by team-graph.test.ts.
