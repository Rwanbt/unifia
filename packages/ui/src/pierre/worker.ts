// WHY here, not just in context/marked.tsx (where this theme registration
// originated for markdown rendering): WorkerPoolManager resolves themes by
// NAME on the main thread before handing them to the Shiki worker — with no
// fallback if "Unifia" isn't registered yet. Relying on marked.tsx's
// module import as the only registration point meant opening a file before
// any markdown had rendered left every syntax-highlighting span uncolored
// (confirmed live: tokens present and correctly split, but a single uniform
// foreground, empty class list — the theme lookup silently found nothing).
// registerCustomTheme() just stores a loader in a Map; calling it twice is
// harmless.
