# CI containers

Prebuilt images intended to speed up GitHub Actions jobs by baking in
large, slow-to-install dependencies. These are designed for Linux jobs
that can use `job.container` in workflows.

Images

- `base`: Ubuntu 24.04 with common build tools and utilities
- `bun-node`: `base` plus Bun and Node.js 24
- `rust`: `bun-node` plus Rust (stable, minimal profile)
- `tauri-linux`: `rust` plus Tauri Linux build dependencies
- `publish`: `bun-node` plus Docker CLI and AUR tooling

Build

```
REGISTRY=ghcr.io/rwanbt TAG=24.04 bun ./packages/containers/script/build.ts
REGISTRY=ghcr.io/rwanbt TAG=24.04 bun ./packages/containers/script/build.ts --push
```

Workflow usage

```
jobs:
  build-cli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/rwanbt/build/bun-node:24.04
```

Notes

- These images only help Linux jobs. macOS and Windows jobs cannot run
  inside Linux containers.
- `--push` publishes multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) images using Buildx.
- If a job uses Docker Buildx, the container needs access to the host
  Docker daemon (or `docker-in-docker` with privileged mode).


Local services

- `docker-compose.searxng.yml`: a loopback-only SearXNG for the `websearch`
  tool (ADR-044). Usage and the Unifia setting are in the file's header; the
  secret key lives in `searxng/.env` (git-ignored). Unifia keeps working when
  the container is stopped: web search is simply not offered.
