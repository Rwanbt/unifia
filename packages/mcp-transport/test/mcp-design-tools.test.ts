/**
 * M8 — DA-CAP-01 / Plan V3 §9.3 verification.
 *
 * Two questions this file answers:
 *
 * 1. **Static**: does the MCP `TOOL_CAPABILITY` map (design-tools.ts:46-52)
 *    stay consistent with the new P3 union? DA-CAP-01 added
 *    `plugin.apply`, `artifact.render`, `designsystem.read`,
 *    `media.generate` to `P3_CAPABILITIES`. If `TOOL_CAPABILITY` ever
 *    returns a name that is NOT in the closed union, the workbench-side
 *    broker will reject the call as an unknown capability (ruleId
 *    "C2-unknown-capability"). The test pins the contract.
 *
 * 2. **Dynamic**: does the JsonRpcClient refuse a tool invocation that
 *    the principal is not entitled to make, BEFORE the call is sent
 *    over the wire, with JSON-RPC -32004 (unauthorized), and with no
 *    side effect on the peer?
 *
 * The `MethodAuthorizer` is a port, not a production policy. The
 * production policy lives in the workbench server. The tests below
 * model a representative host-side authorizer and verify the
 * JsonRpcClient honours ANY conforming authorizer: deny → -32004
 * synchronously, no peer traffic, no rate-limit budget consumed.
