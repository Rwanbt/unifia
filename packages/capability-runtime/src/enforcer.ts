/**
 * Capability Authority enforcer — Plan V2.3.1 §114, ADR-002, ADR-020, ADR-024.
 *
 * Production lift of the M1-05 spike design
 * (docs/automation-v2/spikes/m1-05-capability-enforcer.ts). The spike
 * proved the 5 refusal paths and the grant shape; this module is the
 * canonical, Zod-typed production implementation that the rest of the
 * platform depends on.
 *
 * Order of checks (per M1 plan §3.8 + M1-05 EVIDENCE §4.4):
 *   (1) manifest signed                  → MANIFEST_UNSIGNED
 *   (2) trustClass ≥ capability min trust → TRUSTCLASS_TOO_LOW
 *   (3) principal.capabilities ⊇ {capability}
 *       AND principal.scopes ⊇ requestedScope.ownershipScope
 *                                        → CAPABILITY_NOT_IN_SCOPE  (TM-T-01)
 *   (4) principal.scopes[0] === requestedScope.ownershipScope
 *                                        → SCOPE_CHAIN_BROKEN      (TM-T-02)
 *   (5) mint grant { capability, scope, grantedAt, expiresAt, bindingDigest }
 *
 * Why this order (per M1-05 EVIDENCE §4.4):
 *   - Signature first (provenance / ADR-002): without a signature we
 *     cannot say anything meaningful.
 *   - TrustClass before capability: an `UNTRUSTED_RUNTIME` claiming
 *     `secret.read` is refused *before* a capability lookup, so a
 *     forged `principal.capabilities` cannot mask the attack under a
 *     `CAPABILITY_NOT_IN_SCOPE`.
 *   - Capability in scope: runtime-side authorization (TM-T-01).
 *   - Scope chain: structural invariant (TM-T-02).
 *   - Grant: short-lived, auditable, replay-protected.
