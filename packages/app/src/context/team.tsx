// context/team.tsx — TEAM-M01
//
// Client state for the Team surface and the model registry, shared by the App,
// the desktop shell and mobile.
//
// Three things this context refuses to do, because each of them is a way of
// showing the user something that is not true:
//
//   Truncate silently   Every collection is a page with a cursor. A list that
//                       stops at the first page and looks complete is worse
//                       than a list that says "there is more" — the user has no
//                       way to notice the difference.
//
//   Conflate empty      "The server did not answer" and "there is nothing"
//   with unreachable    render identically if both become an empty array. They
//                       are kept apart end to end: `reachability` is part of
//                       the state, and stale data stays visible and is marked
//                       stale rather than being wiped.
//
//   Pretend to write    The Team runtime in packages/opencode/src/team has no
//                       owner in the running application (R-WIRING-001).
//                       Nothing starts, pauses or cancels a run, so this
//                       context reports lifecycle actions as unavailable —
//                       the same answer the CLI gives with exit 69 — instead
//                       of exposing buttons that would do nothing.
