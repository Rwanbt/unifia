/**
 * Shared Tauri adapter for the desktop and mobile speech hooks.
 *
 * Both platforms use the same lazy `(globalThis as any).__TAURI__` shape —
 * there is no legitimate reason to copy-paste these 15 lines across two
 * packages (which we did, and they already drifted once).
 *
 * Bigger follow-up: the *.ts use-speech hooks share ~800 lines of STT/TTS
 * pipeline (MediaRecorder + blobToWavBase64 + chunked Pocket playback) that
 * should also live here once we have time to factor it cleanly. For now we
 * at least unify the Tauri bridge itself.
