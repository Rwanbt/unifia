/**
 * Stability across full reloads, under session load.
 *
 * This spec was `mode-performance.spec.ts` and claimed "10 mode cycles do not
 * grow heap, listeners, or active queries". It could not prove that: it changes
 * mode with `page.goto()`, a full navigation. Every `goto` destroys the
 * document — mounted components, listeners, stores, the QueryClient, down to
 * the provider's module-level `activeEventStreams` counter. A leak caused by an
 * SPA mode switch would read 20, 40, 60 through the rail; through `goto` it
 * reads 20, 20, 20. The test was green by construction, and it is on that
 * untested path that a mode switch could block the main thread for ~10 s
 * without any test moving.
 *
 * What this spec does measure, and why it is worth keeping:
 *   - counter stability across repeated full navigations;
 *   - behaviour under session load (up to 1 000 prompts);
 *   - the absence of monotonic growth from the start to the end of a long run.
 *
 * What it does NOT measure: a leak caused by mode switches within one document.
 * That is `mode-switch-resource-stability.spec.ts`, which stays in a single
 * document and navigates through the rail.
 *
 * Real volume: 10 cycles x 100 prompts, so up to 1 000 prompts — hence
 * `test.setTimeout(600_000)`. The previous comment announced "one assistant
 * prompt per cycle", which the implementation never did.
 *
 * Instrumentation: `performance.memory` (Chromium) and `window.__UNIFIA_PERF__`.
 * That hook is dev-only since the card that renamed its counters; the previous
 * comment already claimed "the production build strips it", which was false at
 * the time — it was installed under a bare `typeof window === "object"`. This
 * spec runs in dev, where `bun run dev` makes `import.meta.env.DEV` true.
