# Holdout decision: bash tool schema must be strict

The bash tool JSON schema must reject calls that omit the `description`
field. Calls that include the legacy `dry_run` key must be tolerated
but the key must be discarded before forwarding to the executor.

The goal is to keep the tool reliable on smaller instruction-tuned
models that occasionally emit unexpected fields.

Owner: `packages/unifia/src/tool/bash.ts`.
Provenance: 2026 audit catalog entry, see repo history.
