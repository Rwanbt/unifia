# Holdout constraint: long-lived caches must declare their eviction

Any in-process collection that grows with user activity must declare
its maximum size and an eviction policy. A plain `Set` is forbidden
for that role; the project requires a least-recently-used policy
backed by an explicit capacity and time-to-live.
