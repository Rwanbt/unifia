# Holdout failure: K-family quantisation crashes mid-tier Adreno

Quantised models in the K family (Q4_K_M, Q5_K_M) crash the inference
server when executed through OpenCL on Adreno 6xx GPUs.

Resolution: keep the K family on CPU. Reserve OpenCL for Q4_0 and
Q8_0 on Adreno 730 and newer only.

File: `packages/mobile/src/model-catalog.ts`.
