# Holdout decision: per-model thinking budget

Thinking-capable models receive a larger token budget than default
models. The new policy raises the thinking cap to eight thousand one
hundred ninety-two tokens for the supported families. The fallback
default is two thousand forty-eight. A fraction-based fallback is
also accepted.

The previous default of one thousand twenty-four is superseded.
