## [0.4.0-knowledge] - 2026-08-30 (production-readiness counter-review)

### Fixed (security)
- **No capability serves a note the policy denies.** `get()` built its
  candidate with `restriction: "allow"` hardcoded and never called
  `decideEgress` — the defect just removed from the router, reintroduced one
  layer up. A `remote_model: deny` note was served in full remotely, and
  `backlinks` leaked its id and snippet. All read paths now share one
  hydration that resolves the note's own restriction and applies the guard; a
  denied note answers like an absent one.
- **The vault root is a real boundary.** Containment was decided lexically
  while `statSync` follows junctions, so a link inside the vault pointing
  anywhere on disk was walked and read. Decided on realpath now, per entry,
  with cycle detection. Verified against a real Windows junction.
- **Restrictions survive serialisation.** `serialiseNote()` omitted
  `unifia_restrictions`, so a round-trip silently stripped a note's egress
  restrictions.
- **Android evidence is validated.** An empty `ProbeEvidence` produced a PASS
  reading `" on  at : "`.

### Fixed (correctness)
- **Deadlines bound the calls, not the gaps.** A 300ms `list()` ran to
  completion against a 20ms deadline. Now 44ms with `truncated: true`.
- **MCP is composed for real.** The server was constructed nowhere outside
  tests; `mcp-token issue/check/revoke` could not work across processes.
  `mcp/compose.ts` binds workspace, policy, service, registry and server;
  `mcp-token session` exercises the lifecycle honestly.
- **`knowledge_get` returns what its contract declares** — body, id, locator,
  versionHash — and honours `maxBytes`.
- **`trace` walks real lineage** (`unifia_supersedes`) instead of reusing
  backlinks, which mixed in ordinary wikilinks and mislabelled directions.
- **Notes are no longer duplicated** between the personal and project mounts.
- **`status.vector`** reports a loaded model, not a policy flag.
- **`verify --strict`** exits non-zero on WARN or NOT_EXECUTED.
- **`fakeHash`** (32-bit djb2 repeated eight times, cast to
  `KnowledgeVersionHash`) replaced with sha256.
- The CLI kept a second `parseFlags` that dropped bare `--flag` forms.

### Changed
- `commands-report.ts` (891 lines) split into `commands-vault.ts` (525) and
  `commands-graph.ts` (442); dispatcher down to 1045.

### Tests
- 745 passing: 632 TS knowledge (was 612) + 79 contracts + 34 Rust.

### Status
- Verdict: READY_FOR_REVIEW, not PRODUCTION_READY.
- R-0013 opened: no Class A writer, no MCP daemon.
- 0 push, 0 PR, 0 merge, 0 release, 0 publication.

## [0.3.0-knowledge] - 2026-08-29 (remediation after frontier counter-review)

### Fixed (security)
- **Egress overrides can no longer widen a portable `deny`.** `decideEgress`
  evaluated the per-item `allow` override before the item's own restriction,
  so a note marked `remote_model: deny` was returned as `allow` toward a
  permissive provider. Every deny is now decided before any allow.
- **Unresolved provenance is denied toward non-local destinations**
  (ADR-KNOW-0006 §2), instead of being allowed with a note in the reason.
- **The MCP server authenticates.** All six methods were anonymous; the
  workspace was checked on `propose` alone; `status` was unrate-limited.
  Every method now requires a scoped token and passes one guard.
- **MCP tokens** use a 32-byte CSPRNG id (was `Date.now()` + counter), always
  carry a TTL (was: omitting `ttlMs` minted a perpetual token), cap it at 24
  hours, and carry a method allowlist defaulting to read-only.
- **`ExternalSource` capabilities are enforced.** `list`/`read`/`watch`
  reached the backend even when the capability was absent.

### Fixed (correctness)
- **CLI `search` queries the real vault.** It answered from two notes declared
  inline, so any two queries returned `hits=2 scanned=2`.
- **`ContextRouter` honours its contract**: query, types, tags, lifecycle,
  a global `maxCandidates`, UTF-8 `maxSnippetBytes` and `maxPayloadBytes`, a
  real deadline with truncation reported, real snippets and sha256 hashes,
  real lifecycle and provenance, deterministic ranking.
- **`policy.json` reaches the egress decision** through the new
  `facade/compose.ts`. It previously had two consumers, both administrative.
- **Wikilinks and headings inside fenced or inline code are no longer
  extracted.** The parser and the derived indexer each carried their own
  regex; both now share `parser/code-mask.ts`.
- **One lifecycle transition table.** Two copies disagreed with
  `intentForTransition`, which refused `superseded -> active` while both
  tables advertised it. That transition is removed per ADR-KNOW-0009.
- **No fabricated PASS.** Android probes required no evidence; `verify`
  hardcoded `classBReachable: true` and passed on a stub-filesystem
  simulation and on vaults with orphans. Checks now carry
  PASS/WARN/FAIL/NOT_EXECUTED and name the offending files.
- **The facade stops returning empty successes.** `get`, `backlinks` and
  `status` do the work; `propose` refuses with a typed error when no writer
  is configured.
- `cargo fmt --check` was red across all 8 Rust modules while the report
  recorded the Rust gates green.

### Added
- `unifia_restrictions` frontmatter key — a V1 note could not express
  restrictions at all: the strict schema rejected every spelling. One
  canonical representation, fail-closed defaults, `mostRestrictive()` for
  the heritage rule. Recorded as a dated amendment to ADR-KNOW-0006.
- `ProviderDestinationPlan.destinationKind` (`local` | `remote`, omitted =
  remote) so the guard can tell an on-device read from an egress.
- `VaultSource` — the first source that reads Class A from disk.
- `capability_unavailable` error kind.
- `bin/knowledge/` — the CLI was 2048 lines against a 1500-line blocking
  budget and the plan forbids adding to it before decomposing. Split into
  usage, shared, runtime and commands-report; the dispatcher is now 1110.
- Characterization suite `test/knowledge/regression/`, written red.

### Documentation
- `SOVEREIGN-CORE-V1-DOD.md` — every one of the 22 requirements was
  `PENDING`, and all 12 U-commands pointed at `src/` where the tests live in
  `test/`. Audited: 10 PASS, 7 PARTIAL, 4 NOT_EXECUTED, with replayable
  commands.
- `FINAL-REPORT.md` — dated addendum listing the seven refuted claims and
  classifying every surface as implemented / tested with real I/O /
  simulated / disabled / external boundary.
- `PERMISSIONS.md` — five verified misstatements corrected.
- `RISKS.md` — R-0012 opened for the unimplemented parts of ADR-KNOW-0006.

### Tests
- 725 passing: 612 TS knowledge (was 522) + 79 contracts + 34 Rust.

### Status
- Branch: `feat/sovereign-knowledge-core`, no upstream.
- 0 push, 0 PR, 0 merge, 0 release, 0 publication.
