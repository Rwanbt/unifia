## Explicit remaining release limits

1. A hard cost/token budget is evaluated between completed provider calls. Budgeted runs are forced sequential to prevent concurrent overshoot, but one in-flight provider response can exceed its remaining allowance because usage is only authoritative after completion.
2. Pause/resume/cancel controllers are process-local. Durable run state survives restart, but automatic reattachment of an interrupted product run is not part of this lifecycle owner yet.
3. This validation used fakes and local subprocesses, not paid real-provider calls.
4. Release packaging, signing, SBOM and checksums were not performed.

These are release constraints, not silently closed cards. Any production release must either close them or record explicit acceptance with an owner and gate.
