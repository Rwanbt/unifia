# UNIFIA Convergence: Automate, Knowledge, and UI

Single operational roadmap for the current Unifia convergence. GitHub Issues are
the canonical active work state; this file records local execution evidence and
checkpoints only.

> This file now lives on `work-design`, the real trunk since the Automate
> promotion (PR #60). The copy on `agent/automate-v2-baseline-20260901` is
> historical: that branch is content-superseded (see Phase B verdict below) and
> must not be edited as a second dashboard.

## Current Phase

Phase D: convergence certification. Phases A, B and C are closed; the Knowledge
merge is committed on `integration/work-design-knowledge`.

## Current Branch

`integration/work-design-knowledge` (merge commit `732ffbb1a6`), branched from
the assembled `work-design` at `3c8e22e7e6`.

## Current HEAD

See `git rev-parse work-design`. Local trunk assembled 2026-09-08 from
`6ba540abf5` (PR #60) fast-forwarded with `feat/automate-phase1-vertical-slice`
(`cff9551559`) plus one lint repair.

## Source Branches and SHAs

Resolved mechanically 2026-09-07T21:xx UTC. Re-fetch before every integration
action; the values below are checkpoints, not authority.

| Ref | Resolved SHA | Original roadmap checkpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `origin/work-design` | `6ba540abf5` | `1bbbe6a614` | moved: absorbed Automate via squash PR #60 |
| `origin/feat/automate-phase1-vertical-slice` | `cff9551559` | n/a | Automate Phase 1 slice, linear on work-design |
| `origin/agent/automate-v2-baseline-20260901` | `5b750939bd` | `af48118975` | content-superseded; retained for provenance |
| `origin/feat/sovereign-knowledge-core` | `b511ea44f4` | same | unchanged; Knowledge convergence source |
| `origin/dev` | `9535064714` | same | unchanged; final integration target |

Topology, measured not assumed:

- `work-design` ↔ `agent/automate-v2-baseline-20260901`: `1` / `331`. The
  baseline is **not** an ancestor of the trunk; a fast-forward promotion is
  impossible and must not be attempted.
- `work-design` ↔ `feat/sovereign-knowledge-core`: merge-base `91daa35a26`,
  `237` / `179`. Semantic convergence, never a rebase or squash.
- `dev` ↔ `work-design`: `3` / `237`. `dev` holds three commits the trunk lacks.

## Open Blockers

- **Disk**: `D:` has ~4.2 GB free at 100% use. A fresh worktree with
  `node_modules` costs ~2.4 GB, so convergence work reuses the existing
  `unifia-work-design` and `unifia-memory` worktrees. Reclaiming the superseded
  `rev3m-20260901/*` slice worktrees is the first lever if space runs out.
- **tsgo OOM**: `bun turbo typecheck` crashes the Go typechecker under parallel
  execution on this machine (`memory allocation failed`, and a spurious
  `browser-runtime exited (3)`). `--concurrency=1` passes 47/47. Environmental,
  not a product defect; do not "fix" it in the codebase.
- Native desktop certification remains environment-blocked (LLVM OOM / Windows
  paging-file exhaustion), carried over from the previous dashboard.

## Closed Blockers

- #43 canonical WorkflowRun authority and shared fencing: CLOSED as completed
  2026-09-07T13:46Z.
- #44 run isolation and immutable version pinning: CLOSED as completed
  2026-09-07T13:45Z.
- #45 retries blocked while an effect is UNKNOWN: CLOSED as completed
  2026-09-07T13:45Z.
- Automate promotion into `work-design`: landed as squash PR #60
  (`6ba540abf5`, 543 files, 88 310 insertions).
- Automate Phase 1 vertical slice review fixes: `11ff7188ea`, `cff9551559`;
  CI `unifia-conformance` run 34163256514 SUCCESS.

## Phase B Verdict (2026-09-08)

The original roadmap prescribed `git merge --ff-only` from the Automate
baseline. That premise is dead: the promotion happened as a **squash of a
reconstructed A1..A5b slice stack**, so the two histories diverged by
construction. §B2 therefore applies — stop, investigate, recalculate — and the
recalculation is recorded here.

Full mechanical audit of the 40-file delta `work-design` ↔ baseline:

| Direction | Count | Content | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| trunk-only | 7 | IR split (`workflow-effect.ts`, `workflow-recovery.ts`) + 5 focused contract tests | intentional, documented in `AUTOMATE-PROMOTION-PARITY.md` |
| baseline-only | 2 | this roadmap file, `state.md` | review metadata, allowlisted; roadmap now carried to the trunk |
| modified | 31 | P3 effect rows, `.js` import suffixes, fail-closed secret broker, `sha2` 0.10→0.11, stronger #45 restart assertion | trunk side is newer in every case inspected |

Spot-checks that could have hidden a loss, all resolved in the trunk's favour:

- `cf5c12ab53` (idempotent `reconcileEffect` with typed conflict), the only
  baseline code commit after the parity pin, **is present** in the trunk
  (`RECONCILIATION_CONFLICT` ×2 in `native-attempts.ts`); the residual delta on
  those two files is 3 lines of import suffix and one extra trunk assertion.
- `packages/secret-broker`: the trunk carries `OsSecureStorageUnavailableError`
  and the `allowInsecureFallback` fail-closed guard; the baseline does not.
- `native-durable.test.ts`: the trunk asserts that the #45 refusal survives
  restart; the baseline dropped that assertion.

**Conclusion: nothing was lost.** `work-design` is a strict content superset of
`agent/automate-v2-baseline-20260901` except for the two review-metadata files.
The baseline branch is superseded and kept only for provenance. No recovery
work is owed.

## Completed Gates

- ADR-000 / UNIFIA_NATIVE decision: frozen, not reopened.
- FC-13 power-loss qualification: preserved.
- Phase A P0 architecture: all three issues closed as completed.
- Phase B promotion: landed and audited (verdict above).
- Post-merge regression on the assembled trunk, 2026-09-08:
  - `packages/workflow-runtime` 154/154
  - `packages/workbench-server` 103/103
  - `packages/contracts` 648/648
  - `packages/expression-runtime` 8/8
  - `packages/workflow-catalog` 5/5
  - `bun turbo typecheck --concurrency=1` 47/47
  - `bunx biome check .` 0 errors, 15 warnings

## Phase C Verdict (2026-09-08)

Merge-base `91daa35a26a8e44d7f35b539c91030ec1e230c54`. Measured before merging:
Knowledge changed 383 files, the trunk 998, and **only 26 were touched by both**.
Git auto-resolved 21 of those; five needed a decision.

| Conflict | Decision |
|---|---|
| `.gitignore` | union |
| `packages/contracts/package.json` | union: trunk `main`/`types`/`license`/`scripts`, Knowledge `files` + explicit `zod`, export map merged to five entries |
| `packages/contracts/src/index.ts` | additive union; contracts typecheck clean, so no export collision |
| both `unifia-cli.js` bundles | regenerated with `scripts/bundle-mobile.mjs`, never hand-merged |

Knowledge adapted to the trunk, never the reverse:

- `knowledge/parser/frontmatter.ts` called `gray-matter` directly, which only
  worked on the Knowledge branch because a nested `js-yaml@3.15.1` sat under
  gray-matter there. The trunk keeps ONE js-yaml (4.3.1) and routes every call
  site through `util/frontmatter.ts`. After the merge the nested copy is gone,
  so the parser threw on every note: **229 of 821 Knowledge tests failed**.
  Routing it through the wrapper restores 821/821, the branch's own baseline.
- 43 Knowledge files lacked the SPDX header the trunk's pre-commit gate
  requires. Headers added rather than the gate weakened. The 31 that carry YAML
  frontmatter take the identifier as a YAML comment inside the frontmatter,
  because gray-matter only sees frontmatter starting at byte 0.

Generated artifacts regenerated, not merged: `bun.lock` (one missing
`@unifia/mcp-transport` workspace link recovered, no version change),
`packages/sdk/openapi.json` and `types.gen.ts` (`script/generate.ts`, enforced
at zero drift by `observability-sdk-drift`).

Checks that could have hidden a loss:

- i18n union verified arithmetically on `en.ts`: 1660 base + 124 trunk + 22
  Knowledge = 1806 keys. No duplicate, no dropped key.
- Knowledge's `memory` settings block survives intact in `config-schema.ts`
  (merged file byte-identical to the Knowledge side, +42 lines vs the trunk).

## Current Gate

Phase D certification on `integration/work-design-knowledge`.

Green so far on the merged tree:

- `bun turbo typecheck --concurrency=1`: 47/47, all real executions
- Knowledge suite: 821/821 (4199 expects), equal to its own branch baseline
- `crates/unifia-knowledge-core`: 35/35
- workflow-runtime 154/154, workbench-server 103/103, contracts 695/695,
  expression-runtime 8/8, workflow-catalog 5/5
- `bunx biome check .`: 1733 files, 0 errors, 13 pre-existing warnings
- eval isolation: 11 dev / 11 holdout fixtures, no shared id, no shared 5-gram

Attributed and closed (2026-09-08):

**The exhaustive `packages/unifia` suite carries pre-existing red on every ref;
the convergence adds none of it.** Two identical runs of the merged tree gave
5077/47 and 5074/50 failures out of 5134 tests, and the variance between two
runs of the same tree is itself the first evidence. Attribution, per file:

- Of the 15 files reporting failures, 14 have their test AND their source
  untouched by both sides since the merge-base. A merge can only inject a
  regression where both sides changed the same thing, and none of these lie on
  the 26-file shared surface.
- The 15th, `test/tool/memory.test.ts`, is a Knowledge-only file (421 lines,
  never touched by the trunk).
- Three like-for-like isolated comparisons, merged tree vs the Knowledge branch,
  came out **exactly equal**: `file/path-traversal` 14 pass / 9 fail on both;
  `tool/memory` 5 pass / 7 fail on both; `session/prompt-effect` +
  `tool/bash` 76 pass / 19 fail on both.

Residual channel, stated rather than hidden: `packages/unifia/package.json` and
`bun.lock` ARE on the shared surface, so dependency resolution can still change
behaviour anywhere. That is precisely the channel the js-yaml defect travelled
through, which is why it was found and fixed rather than assumed away.

**The three red builds are pre-existing trunk breakage, structurally proven.**
`packages/web`, `packages/console` and `packages/storybook` are byte-identical
to the trunk in the merged tree, and the only lock line touching that toolchain
family is a `vitest` devDependency added for `@unifia/contracts`. `@unifia/web`
fails because the trunk bumped `@astrojs/cloudflare` 12.6.6 to 14.2.1 (starlight
0.34 to 0.41) without the build following; `@unifia/storybook` aborts with
exit 134, this machine's OOM signature.

Two findings surfaced but NOT fixed here, because neither belongs to the
convergence scope:

1. `packages/unifia/src/team/lock-manager.ts` hardcodes an absolute
   developer-machine path (`D:\Documents\Obsidian\IA_Dev_Brain\OpenCode\...`)
   as its default lock directory and `mkdirSync`s it, so running the test suite
   writes a SQLite lease DB into that user's Obsidian vault. It predates the
   merge-base and is identical on all three refs.
2. The project path-escape guard does not reject `../../../etc/passwd` on this
   platform: `File.read` resolves where the test expects a rejection. Also
   identical on all refs, with `src/file/index.ts` untouched by Knowledge.

Not run in this session, and therefore not claimed: D7 cross-mode journey,
D8 reload matrix, D9 responsive pre-check. They need a live app and a browser.

## Next Exact Action

1. Run D7/D8/D9 (cross-mode journey, reload matrix, responsive pre-check)
   before Phase F freezes the UI reference.
2. Triage the two surfaced findings above as their own issues; keep them out of
   the convergence change.
3. Rollback anchor, should the trunk ever have to be walked back: `6ba540abf5`
   is what `origin/work-design` pointed at before publication.

## Tests Baseline

Pre-convergence trunk figures are the "Completed Gates" block above. Any
Knowledge merge that moves them down is a regression to resolve, not to accept.

## Known Deviations

- The roadmap's `work-design`, `dev` and Automate baseline values were
  checkpoints, not current refs; §1, §2, §3 and §B1 of the source roadmap are
  superseded by the resolved values and the Phase B verdict above.
- The source roadmap instructs creating this dashboard; it already existed on
  the Automate baseline. It was carried here rather than duplicated, per §0
  ("do not create competing master plans").
- 13 pre-existing Biome warnings remain outside the Automate scope
  (`file-backed.ts`, `in-memory.ts`, `native-durable.test.ts`,
  `m2-control-while-child.test.ts`, `m0-proof.test.ts`). Not entering the
  convergence change; route through normal triage.

## Conflict Decisions

- Work-Design/Automate stays the shell and runtime authority.
- Knowledge stays the authority for Knowledge persistence, retrieval, indexing
  and policy only. It never becomes WorkflowRun durable authority.
- No blanket ours/theirs resolution anywhere in the repository.

## Remote Mutation

Owner authorised the convergence merges on 2026-09-08 (Automate, Knowledge and
Work-Design). That authorisation is scoped to this convergence; it does not
extend to `dev`, to PR creation, to tags, or to branch-protection changes.
Earlier sessions' authorisations are never inherited.

## UI Reference

`UNSELECTED`. Freeze v103 or v104 only after Knowledge convergence is green and
the owner source-of-truth gate is explicit.
