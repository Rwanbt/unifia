# Branch Archive - 2026-09-08

The repository carried 55 local and 23 remote branches. It now carries exactly
three, locally and on the remote: `main`, `dev`, `work-design`. Nothing was
destroyed: every deleted branch was first written to `refs/archive/2026-09-08/`,
which is not a branch namespace and so does not appear in branch listings or in
the GitHub branch UI.

## Restoring anything here

```
git fetch origin 'refs/archive/*:refs/archive/*'
git branch <name> refs/archive/2026-09-08/<name>
```

The 20 branches that existed on `origin` have their archive ref on `origin` too,
so they are recoverable from a fresh clone. The 30 local-only branches have
their archive ref in this clone only.

## Why branch deletion could not be proved safe the usual way

The obvious test - is the branch an ancestor of the trunk - clears only 5 of 52
branches, because this repository squash-merges and because the Automate
promotion (PR #60) squashed a reconstructed A1..A5b slice stack. Ancestry was
destroyed by the workflow, not by anything missing.

Two tests were used instead:

1. **Contribution test.** `git merge-tree --write-tree <keeper> <branch>`; if the
   resulting tree equals the keeper's tree, merging the branch would change
   nothing, so it carries nothing new. This test yields false alarms when it hits
   conflicts: `merge-tree` writes conflict markers into the tree, which then read
   as added lines in a diff. Every such case here was inspected and the trunk
   side was the richer one.
2. **New-file test.** Files the branch added since its merge-base that do not
   exist in the trunk at all. A missing file cannot be a conflict artifact, so
   this is the decisive signal, and it is what found the two exceptions below.

Three classes appear in the table below. **CONTAINED** = the trunk provably
holds the content. **SUPERSEDED** = the branch adds no file the trunk lacks and
a later revision of the same slice is CONTAINED. **PRESERVED** = the branch does
add files the trunk lacks, and is an ancestor of a branch that was kept.

The pivot for the whole Automate family: `integration/automate-promotion-candidate-20260907`
and the squash commit `6ba540abf5` have the **same tree**, `1b01dfceb4`. The
squash preserved content exactly, so every ancestor of the candidate is contained
in the trunk.

## Not deleted - these carried work the trunk did not have

Both were resolved the same day. Their status is recorded below each entry.

### `integration/rev3m-20260901/work` - MERGED, branch now deleted

17 files that do not exist in `work-design` at all - the rev3m review cycle's
Knowledge hardening:

- `test/knowledge/containment/` - W-FS TOCTOU (in-window and plain), maxdepth,
  siblings, maxnotebytes, unicode
- `test/knowledge/mutation/` - writer atomicity, lock PID, lock reentrancy,
  supersede CAS, writer stress plus its child-process helper
- `test/knowledge/mcp/` - token concurrency and token persistence
- `src/cli/knowledge/commands-{hardening,list,workspace}.ts` - the split of an
  817-line `main.ts`

The seven sibling branches (`agent/pr3m-20260831-090426/{c24,w-fs,w-mut,w-run-01}`
and `fix/rev3m-20260901/{w-fs,w-mut,w-run-01}`) are all **ancestors** of this
branch, so this one branch preserves the entire cycle. They were archived and
deleted.

Landed on the trunk as merge commit `cc2472e2d1` (`--no-ff`, provenance kept).
The branch forked from the Knowledge tip `b511ea44f4`, which the trunk had since
absorbed, so from that merge-base the branch changed 38 files against the trunk's
1045 with only **two shared**: `bun.lock` and `packages/unifia/package.json` -
the dependency channel the convergence flagged as invisible to `git diff`. It was
checked first: the lock came out byte-identical, since the one line the branch
added was already present. Zero conflicts.

Verified on the merged tree: Knowledge suite **892 pass / 1 skip / 0 fail** (up
from 821/821), the landed containment + mutation + mcp tests 154/154, e2e 13/13,
typecheck 47/47, biome 0 errors, and no Automate regression (154/154, 103/103,
695/695) with the Rust crate at 35/35.

One thing this merge proved about itself: the suite first reported 892 pass with
the e2e driving a binary built five hours *before* any of these commits - green,
and evidence of nothing. The branch's own `turbo.json` change makes `unifia#test`
depend on `unifia#build` for exactly that reason. Rebuilt and re-run, the e2e is
13/13 against this tree.

The branch was archived and deleted once it was a true ancestor of `work-design`.

### `feat/unifia-rebrand-cli-tui` - CLI/TUI part LANDED; the rest deliberately not ported

Its committed content adds no file the trunk lacks, but its worktree -
`D:/App/unifia/unifia`, the primary checkout - holds **40 modified files,
+9885/-7130**, uncommitted: brand colors, a letter-based wordmark, favicons,
icons, and i18n across 15 languages. The trunk's `logo.ts` is the older, smaller
version, so this is real unmerged design work.

It sits on the pre-rename layout (`packages/opencode/`, which the trunk renamed
to `packages/unifia/`), so it needs porting rather than merging.

The uncommitted state was captured, without touching the worktree, at
`refs/archive/2026-09-08/wip/unifia-rebrand-cli-tui`. A second capture,
`refs/archive/2026-09-08/wip/automate-a4-workbench`, holds a one-line test edit
from a worktree that was removed.

Checked against both `dev` and `work-design`, because the rebrand was believed to
have landed already. What landed is the **specification**, not the code:
`brand/unifia/` carries the theme, the tokens and `cli/unifia-cli-lockup.json`,
and the brand colors `#8700FF` / `#0068FF` appear in the tree **only** in that
lockup file and its README. No source file reads them; the lockup is referenced
only by `brand-manifest.json`, another spec file. Both refs still ship the older
`packages/unifia/src/cli/logo.ts` (508 bytes, no `brandColors`, no per-character
colouring, no compact form), consumed by `cli/ui.ts` and
`cli/cmd/tui/component/logo.tsx`. The uncommitted worktree holds the 1155-byte
implementation of that published spec.

The CLI and TUI part landed as `e6372eed5e`. The built binary now prints the
approved lockup, in 24-bit colour derived from `brandColors` at the point of use
so a second copy of the hex values cannot drift from the spec, and honouring
`NO_COLOR`. `test/cli/logo.test.ts` was rewritten to assert the code against the
lockup file rather than against copies of its numbers, and mutation-tested.

The rest of that worktree was deliberately left, and the reasons are worth
keeping because "port the whole diff" would have made things worse:

- `packages/ui/logo.tsx` and `favicon.tsx`: the trunk is **better**. It crops each
  brand SVG to its own `getBBox` bounding box, and keeps the webmanifest and
  apple-touch-icon that the worktree version drops for an SVG-only favicon.
- `app/`, `desktop/`, the three tauri configs: already rebranded on the trunk,
  with fewer OpenCode references than the worktree has.
- `desktop/src-tauri/src/windows.rs`: both keep `window.__OPENCODE__`; only the
  trunk explains in a comment that the JS global is a compatibility contract.
- `console/app/src/routes/brand/index.tsx`: the worktree version aliases all
  eight PNG variants to one file and points the brand-assets download at
  `site.webmanifest`, a JSON manifest. Its targets also resolve against
  `packages/console/public/` rather than the app's own `public/`, so they 404.
  That page needs a real Unifia asset set produced before it can be rebranded.
- The mobile favicon links swap one dangling path for another and label an `.svg`
  as `image/png`; only the `<title>` was corrected.

What remains open is therefore the console brand page, and it is an
asset-production task rather than a code port.

The branch itself is now gone. Its tip is at
`refs/archive/2026-09-08/feat/unifia-rebrand-cli-tui` (`357ec12229`) and its
uncommitted state at `refs/archive/2026-09-08/wip/unifia-rebrand-cli-tui`, which
was verified byte-identical to the working tree immediately before the cleanup
and additionally stashed in the main repository. `D:/App/unifia/unifia` is the
main repository rather than a worktree, so it could not be removed; it was moved
to `main`, which the untracked files did not collide with.

Of the 143 untracked files that checkout left in place, 125 are byte-identical to
content already tracked on the trunk. The other 18 were checked one by one and
the trunk is richer or more correct in every case: its `brand-manifest.json` is
912 lines against 102, its `cli/README.md` points at `drop-in/packages/unifia/`
where the local copy still said `opencode`, `sprint3.test.ts` already lives at
`packages/unifia/test/knowledge/`, and the manifest itself classifies
`.unifia-brand-backup/` as local backup and the icon variants as generated
output, so the loose local icons are stale artifacts of that pipeline.

## Orphaned directories on disk - removed

`git worktree remove` unregistered 24 worktrees and freed about 4.2 GB, but
Windows kept the file trees (EBUSY). Deleting them afterwards freed a further
~82 GB, because each carried its own `node_modules`. Free space on the volume
went from 3.7 GB to 90 GB across the whole cleanup. The paths were:

```
D:\App\unifia\.worktrees\phase1-20260907
D:\App\unifia\.worktrees\pr3m-20260831-090426
D:\App\unifia\.worktrees\rev3m-20260901
D:\App\unifia\unifia-memory
```
