# Security

## IMPORTANT

We do not accept AI generated security reports. We receive a large number of
these and we absolutely do not have the resources to review them all. If you
submit one that will be an automatic ban from the project.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.3.x   | ✅ Yes (current)   |
| 1.2.x   | ⚠️ Security fixes only |
| < 1.2   | ❌ No              |

> This fork (`Rwanbt/unifia`) tracks the latest upstream release. Patches are backported to the current minor series only.

## Threat Model

### Overview

Unifia is an AI-powered coding assistant that runs locally on your machine. It provides an agent system with access to powerful tools including shell execution, file operations, and web access.

### No Sandbox

Unifia does **not** sandbox the agent. The permission system exists as a UX feature to help users stay aware of what actions the agent is taking - it prompts for confirmation before executing commands, writing files, etc. However, it is not designed to provide security isolation.

If you need true isolation, run Unifia inside a Docker container or VM.

### Server Mode

Server mode is opt-in only. When enabled, set `UNIFIA_SERVER_PASSWORD` to require HTTP Basic Auth. Without this, the server runs unauthenticated (with a warning). It is the end user's responsibility to secure the server - any functionality it provides is not a vulnerability.

### Out of Scope

| Category                        | Rationale                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Server access when opted-in** | If you enable server mode, API access is expected behavior              |
| **Sandbox escapes**             | The permission system is not a sandbox (see above)                      |
| **LLM provider data handling**  | Data sent to your configured LLM provider is governed by their policies |
| **MCP server behavior**         | External MCP servers you configure are outside our trust boundary       |
| **Malicious config files**      | Users control their own config; modifying it is not an attack vector    |
